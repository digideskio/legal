Microcosm Legal Documents
=========================

This repository stores our legal documents such as terms and conditions, privacy policy and cookie policy.

Work in progress is in the master branch, and we will tag releases when they are applied to the service.

The purpose of this repository is to allow changes to be viewed over time and to provide a space in which the terms under which we provide the service can be discussed.

If you are a forum user, we encourage you to ask questions relating to the documents and how they may affect you. You can use Github Issues or check-in comments to do this.

Note: Not all forums run by Microcosm will use these documents. Please check the documents linked in the footer of the forum.

Warning
-------

DO NOT COPY THESE DOCUMENTS WITHOUT CONSULTING A LAWYER

Using these documents on another service, taking them as your own without editing them, and making edits without legal advice: may significantly impact any protection they offer.

Our documents have been created for our specific use-case of running a platform of hosted forums. Our documents likely do not apply to any other uses. As such they may offer you no protection at all, and the false sense of security may prevent you from seeking the legal advice that you should seek.
